# pymon
System monitor

It is designed for WD MyBook Live Duo. It's based on Power CPU (32-bit). 

It has python 2.5 by default and python 3.7 installed bu ipkg, and it doesn't have any hardware monitoring software, excluding smartctl.

It seems, that it is impossible to install something like prometheus+grafana, zabbix, munin etc. So, I used to write something to monitor hardware health.
